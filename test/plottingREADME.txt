To run the plotting macro:

python plot.py --var "HISTOGRAM-YOU-WOULD-LIKE-TO-PLOT"

Note: Passing 1 with the logScale option will produce plots with the y axis on a logarithmic scale.


You can also make use of the automated plotter script 'autoplot.sh':

1. Fill the text file 'histostoplot.txt' with the names of all the histograms you would like to produce
2. ./autoplot.sh
